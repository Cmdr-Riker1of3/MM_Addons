The KBS Mechs and Vehicle files
The Tech Readouts for these units can be found at the following locations:

Kronos Battle Systems [KBS]:


This mechpack contains the units and variants listed, along with a few
other units that are unlisted, bonus variants, or works in progress.
To install:

Copy the folder

KBS Mechpack

to [Megamek/MechHQ folder]/data/mechfiles.

4: The KBS image pack (optional)
These are unit images for MegaMek, created using the following
programs:
DoGA (used to create an inital image in png format)
GIMP (Used to convert the png image to 84 x 72 grayscale gif)

Installing this part takes longer, but is well worth it to use
 the new images for the KBS Mechs you added in part 3.

Step 1:
Copy the following to [Megamek/MechHQ folder]/data/images/units

Folder: KBS_Units
file: KBS_Mechset.txt

Step 2:
Open either:

mechset.txt
localclient_mechset.txt
localserver_mechset.txt

located in [Megamek/MechHQ folder]/data/images/units.

Step 3a:
If you opened either
localclient_mechset.txt
localserver_mechset.txt

At the end of the file, add the following lines:

# Kronos Battle Systems units
include kbs_mechset.txt

Procede to step 4.

Step 3b:
If you opened the file

mechset.txt

Locate these lines:

        # As of v0.29.61, mechset files can include other mechset files.
        include localserver_mechset.txt

        # these 18 must be in here
        
After "include Localserver_mechset.txt" add the lines

        # Kronos Battle Systems units
        include kbs_mechset.txt

When done, it should look like this:

        # As of v0.29.61, mechset files can include other mechset files.
        include localserver_mechset.txt
        # Kronos Battle Systems units
        include kbs_mechset.txt

        # these 18 must be in here

Procede to step 4.

Step 4:
Save the changes. Now you should see the new images with the new mechs
